# AtmMachine_project
A simple Java-based ATM simulation allowing users to interact with an ATM through a console interface. Key features include:

    PIN Authentication: Users must enter a correct PIN (default: 1105) to access functionalities.
    Menu Options: Choose from checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, or exiting.
    Transactions: Handle balance checks, withdrawals (with balance verification), and deposits.

The project demonstrates basic Java programming and console-based user interactions.
